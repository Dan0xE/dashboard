## Dashboard

This is a small projekt i started working on in early 2020 to learn more about the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework as well as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The project is a dashboard that displays the current weather in a given city. The project is still in development and i will continue to work on it in my spare time.

The projekt started out as a webapp but i have since decided to make it into a desktop app using [Tauri](https://www.tauri.app/). The reason for this is because i wanted to build a file explorer and a text editor into the app. I have since decided to make the file explorer and text editor into seperate projects.
